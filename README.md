# Google IP Hunter

This project, GoogleIPHunter, is mainly for collecting global google ipv4 addresses. Mostly Google Global Cache IPs (GGC), also with Official IPs.

GGC only provides with two kinds of certificates (gws - google.com & gvs - googlevideo.com).

You can check Google's Official GGC Distribution Map here: https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure

## How you hunt for them?

By online searching.

## How to Use?

Try to scan the IP ranges by using multiple IP scanning tools (like gscan, gogotester etc.). Both available **gws** and **gvs** ips can be used in Google Cloud Engine Proxy Tools (goagent, goproxy etc.), but only **gws** ips can be used by hosts file (not recommended due to the new strategy of national firewall to block Google IPs).
